    <!--<p>I met Rebecca at a party on April 1, 2011. Like a true April Fool, I left that night without getting her number, but I couldn't get her off my mind. I decided to try the only thing I could think of -- MIT's "missed connections" website, I Saw You MIT. You can see the original post <a href="https://isawyou.mit.edu/post.php?id=4076">here</a>.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Luckily, Rebecca saw the post and replied to me the very next day. We started chatting on Facebook and eventually via text (a true Millenial courtship) before deciding to meet up for lunch. I had never been so nervous about anything in my life (well, maybe a physics exam...) but when I saw her at the end of MIT's Infinite Corridor she was just as stunning as I remembered. (She didn't tell me until much later, but this was the first good look that she got of me, because she wasn't wearing her glasses at the party when we met. I'll chalk that up to some sort of divine intervention to give me a chance with my charming personality.)</p>-->
    <!--<p>For the next month, we dated casually but I could not get this girl off of my mind. This was the busiest part of any semester I had at MIT, including one 36 hour period where I had 4 exams and a paper due, but looking forward to the next time that I would get to see this girl from Long Island kept me sane. On May 6, 2011, exactly 6 years before our wedding day, Rebecca and I became an official couple. I was absolutely head over heels for her from the beginning, and I still am to this day.</p>-->
