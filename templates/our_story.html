                    <p>The first thing I noticed about Tommy was his hair. This was back before I wore contacts and was too vain to go out in my glasses so I braved the MIT party scene half-blind. That meant a boy had to either catch the eye of one of my friends and have them point him out to me or he had to have easily distinguishable features. Fortunately for Tommy he was both tall and had a great big mop of blond hair on his head. </p>
                    <p>On the night in question Nihara (current MOH), Olivia (current bridesmaid), and I were partying it up with the brothers of Sigma Phi Epsilon (for the parents reading this by “partying” I mean studying, clearly – this is how millennials talk). When the tall boy with the blond hair walked in I remember noticing him enough to ask the girls if he was cute. Unfortunately, I quickly got distracted by the games and people whom I didn’t have to squint across the room to see (parents: by games I mean flash cards, we’re studying remember?).  </p>
                    <p>A while later, Nihara, Olivia, and I decided to take a break and crash onto one of the frat’s beanbag chairs to take a minute and recoup. There were two chairs but one was already taken so the three of us squished our bottoms onto the same chair. This was when the occupant of the other chair spoke up. “You ladies look a little cramped over there, would one of you like to share with me?” The occupant was tall and had a big blond mass of curly hair.</p>
                    <p>In the intervening years this line has sparked much debate. While I admit that I don’t remember the exact verbiage used by my esteemed fiancé, I maintain that it was generic enough to imply that he was asking any of the three of us to join him. He maintains that he, of course, had eyes only for me. Nihara and Olivia have wisely stayed out of it but I’m sure there’s some alternate universe out there where things played out much differently. </p>
                    <p>Putting aside the concept of parallel timelines, what happened in this one was that I, the friendliest member of our group, kindly agreed to let my lovely friends have more room on their beanbag chair and plunked myself down next to blondie. I introduced myself in the MIT style (name, courses, hometown, and relationship status) and learned that his name was Tommy and that he was Course 6 (computer science for all of you who don’t have brass rats). I wish I remember more of that initial conversation but, sadly, the avid studying that my friends and I had been doing all night left everything a blur. I do remember that it was a long conversation and must have been going well because at some point the fraternity brother who had invited us over (let’s call him Jake) got jealous and sent Nihara over to pull me away. I remember her bouncing over and whispering subtly (in what was probably a gentle roar) that Jake didn’t think I should talk to this guy anymore. “Why?” I asked. She shrugged and, having no actual reason why I should stop talking to Tommy, left me to my conversation. </p>
                    <p>The rest of the night consisted of a tug-of-war for my attention. I’ll spare you all the details but let’s just say that it involved games of pong (ping-pong parents, ping pong!), spilled beverages (namely apple juice of course), and general shenanigans. My ego loved it. As the night wore on and decision-making abilities became more impeded, Tommy threw in the towel. He left with his friends and I left with mine (that’s my story and I’m sticking to it).</p>
                    <p>The next day I got a message from Olivia who, like all good friends, always checked isawyouMIT after a night out. For those of you unfamiliar with it, isawyouMIT is a missed connections website aimed specifically at the MIT community. She messaged me because she had found this:</p>
                    <div class="center_text"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/isawyou.PNG') }}"></div>
                    <p>After confirming with her that this was, in fact, me, I clicked on the email icon and messaged back. Within a few hours we had a lunch date set up. I’d like to say the rest is history and spare you all another page or two of writing but things weren’t quite the easy sailing one might have guessed.</p>
                    <p>Having not dated in high school very much, I wasn’t one for relationships and wasn’t eager to settle down. Having quickly pinned Tommy down as a “nice guy” my friends went about subtly warning him not to get too attached. Posts of Taio Cruz’s “Break Your Heart” and Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” were added to my wall tagging Tommy and my loyal friends told me to flat out break things off before I broke Tommy’s heart. Some showed a little more foresight, namely Katie (current bridesmaid) who took one look at him and told me I was in trouble.</p>
                    <p>By May I could no longer avoid the relationship conversation. Summer was approaching and I couldn’t keep leaving things up in the air. On May 5, 2011 Tommy asked me to be his girlfriend. In a rush of clarity I realized he was all I ever wanted and said yes, yes, a million times yes! Nope, just kidding I didn’t. In reality, I panicked, told him he wasn’t supposed to fall for me, said I didn’t want to be in a relationship and ground his heart into a little pile of metaphorical mush. (Sorry Mom). The next night was a Friday and I was supposed to be going to a friend’s party. Tommy had come over earlier (miraculously setting aside his broken heart with an inspiring determination to not give up on me) and we were sitting in my tiny dorm room watching the movie Shrek. As we watched animated ogres and donkeys frolic across the screen I felt a strange disinclination to leave. Suddenly the thought of cuddling up and watching the rest of this movie was more appealing than heading out to a loud, crazy party with lots of boys and b…um apple juice. On an impulse I paused the movie and turned to Tommy. “I want to give this a try.” And so, on May 6, 2011, I mended Tommy’s heart and found my own.</p>
                    <p>Six years later, we’ll be saying our vows in front of friends and family. Our story can be romanticized: boy meets girl, boy doesn’t get girl’s number, boy posts on social media and against all odds they find each other and fall in love. But the true story that I’ve just told isn’t so pretty. It’s the story of a girl who didn’t want to get her heart broken and locked it away behind a façade of parties and unwillingness to commit. And it’s the story of a boy who didn’t give up on that girl. Who stayed with her no matter how many times she turned him away out of fear. A boy who was sweet and kind and loving and proved to me that he will always be there, no matter what. A boy who showed me what true love is and who healed my heart in more ways than he’ll ever know.</p>
                    <p>Tommy, I love you and I can’t wait to share the rest of my life with you. Love, forever and always, Rebecca</p>

                    <p>I met Rebecca at a party on April 1, 2011. I noticed her as soon as she came in, but I was too shy to talk to her for a while. This girl was stunning, and I never considered myself much of a party person, so what chance did I have? Eventually, as I was sitting in a big chair and she was sitting in an identical chair nearby with 2 of her friends, I very smoothly asked her if she’d like to join me in mine instead. We talked for the better part of an hour about our majors, our families, where we were from, and we hit it off really well. Unfortunately, like a true April Fool, I left that night without getting her number, but I was determined to get back in touch with her. I decided to try the only thing I could think of – MIT's "missed connections" website, I Saw You MIT, in the hopes of once again getting to see this girl from Long Island. You can see the original post <a href="https://isawyou.mit.edu/post.php?id=4076" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>Luckily, Rebecca saw the post and replied to me the very next day. We started chatting on Facebook and eventually via text (a classic Millennial courtship) before deciding to meet up for lunch. I had never been so nervous about anything in my life but when I saw her at the end of MIT's Infinite Corridor she was even more beautiful than I remembered. She didn't tell me until much later, but this was the first good look that she got of me, because she wasn't wearing her glasses at the party when we met. I'll assume that was some sort of divine intervention to give me a chance to win her over with my charming personality first.</p>
                    <p>For the next month, we dated casually but I couldn’t get her off of my mind. This was the busiest part of any semester I had at MIT, but looking forward to the next time that I would get to see this incredible girl kept me going. We spent most of our free time together, and I quickly developed strong feelings for her. On May 6, 2011 (exactly 6 years before our wedding day) Rebecca and I became an official couple. I was absolutely head over heels for her from the beginning, and I still am to this day.</p>
                    <p>That summer, Rebecca went back home to Long Island while I stayed at MIT for work. It was tough being apart so soon after we met, but early in the summer I visited her at home for my birthday (she took me to see How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying on Broadway). That trip solidified a lot of strong feelings that I had for her in so many ways, and it’s one of my favorite memories in our long relationship. Seeing the sights of New York City (including Gus the polar bear) and getting to spend an entire weekend with Rebecca was perfect, and I knew right then that I’d be happy to spend every weekend with her for the rest of my life. Staying at her parents’ house and seeing their interactions as a family gave me a glimpse into what our future together might look like, and ever since that trip I’ve looked forward to the day that I get to marry the girl of my dreams.</p>
                    <p>Rebecca visited every couple of weeks for the rest of the summer (despite the lack of air conditioning in my tiny dorm room), and when school started up again we basically lived together, alternating between our two dorms every other week. The next summer, Rebecca took a leap of faith and travelled across the country to spend the summer with me in San Francisco. That was the first time we had ever really lived together, and I think it was a huge step in our relationship. Our apartment was awful, we didn’t know anyone in the area, and yet we made it through that summer and came out stronger from our time together. I’ll be forever grateful for Rebecca taking that step with me, and I promise I’ll never make her follow me across the country to live in a mouse infested apartment again. I think making it through that summer was important in showing us that we could make it through a tough situation and come out the other end together.</p>
                    <p>I soon graduated from MIT, and while most of my friends moved across the country, I couldn’t bear the thought of being away from Rebecca. Luckily, I found a great job in Boston so I got to stay in a city that I loved with a girl that I loved even more. I was worried at first about the transition from school life to work life and what that would do to our relationship, but things only got better once we settled into our new routine. Rebecca put a lot of effort into our relationship that year, helping me settle into my new job and adjust to “adult” life. She even took the bus across the river to campus every morning since she was willing to stay with me in my apartment. I was a little concerned when she took her 3 week trip to Sri Lanka that she would never come back to me, but I guess she likes me more than elephants which is definitely saying something. Before long, she graduated and we moved into our own new apartment that was conveniently located right next to my office (and nowhere near hers – I promise she had equal say in that choice, apparently she just loves me enough to let that slide).</p>
                    <p>One thing that had been missing from both of our lives for too long was a dog, and with our own dog-friendly apartment and disposable income, we decided to take the plunge and bring our corgi Ellie into our lives. It was even tougher to win over her love than it was for me to win over Rebecca’s, but luckily we stuck with it and now we have our own happy family. We’ve also started to travel the world and there’s absolutely no other person that I’d rather share my adventures with than Rebecca. There are a lot of beautiful things in this world, and I honestly feel that Rebecca and I bring out the best in each other and help each other to see that beauty.</p>
                    <p>Ever since I met her, Rebecca has been my number one priority and I’m incredibly grateful for all of the things she’s brought into my life. I’ve never met such a thoughtful, intelligent, passionate person who genuinely cares about others more than she cares about herself. Even with her busy life, she’s always willing to go out of her way to help out a friend or a colleague, and I know that everyone who’s lucky enough to be a part of her life is better off for it. Here’s to a lifetime of love and happiness with Rebecca, the girl from Long Island, my better half and the person I’m honored to call my best friend and my soulmate – I hope that our wedding is everything you dreamed of, and I can’t wait to continue this journey that has brought so much love and joy into my life. I love you.</p>
